# Content Author Guides

These guides are for people who write content for Uniweb sites. No coding experience required — you'll work with text files, markdown, and simple configuration.

If you're building components or foundations, see the [developer guides](../developers/).

## Guides

### [Writing Content](./writing-content.md)

How to write sections using markdown — headings, paragraphs, images, links, icons, and backgrounds. This is the foundation of everything else.

### [Recipes](./recipes.md)

Copy-paste patterns for common sections: hero banners, feature grids, FAQs, team pages, testimonials, and more. Find the layout you want and adapt the content.

### [Site Setup](./site-setup.md)

Configure your site — `site.yml`, page structure, locales, search, and collections. Everything that shapes how your site is organized.

### [Theming](./theming.md)

Customize your site's visual identity — colors, fonts, section themes, and dark mode. One file (`theme.yml`) controls how the entire site looks.

### [Translating Your Site](./translating-your-site.md)

The translation workflow for multilingual sites — extracting text, managing translation files, and verifying coverage.

## How These Guides Work

Each guide focuses on one topic and assumes you've read the quickstart. You don't need to read them in order — jump to whatever you need. The writing style is practical: here's what you do, here's what happens, here's what to try next.

You'll never see JSX, component code, or technical jargon in these guides. If something requires coding, it belongs in the [developer guides](../developers/).
