/**
 * Foundation Exports
 *
 * Optional file to export foundation-level capabilities to the runtime:
 * - Layout: Custom page layout component (receives header, body, footer, sidebars)
 * - props: Foundation-wide props accessible via website.foundationProps
 *
 * The Layout component receives pre-rendered page areas as props:
 * - page, website: Runtime context
 * - header, body, footer: Core page regions (pre-rendered React elements)
 * - left/leftPanel, right/rightPanel: Sidebar panels
 *
 * If this file is not provided, the runtime uses a default layout (header -> body -> footer).
