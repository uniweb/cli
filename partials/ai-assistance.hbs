## Developer Guide

[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) is a comprehensive guide to building with Uniweb — content authoring, component development, theming, configuration, and the kit API. Despite the name, it's written for developers and AI assistants alike. Read it to get productive fast.

### AI Prompts

AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) read AGENTS.md automatically. Some prompts to try:

**Converting an existing design:**
```
I have a landing page design in `homepage.jsx`. Convert it into this Uniweb
project. Decompose each visual section into a foundation component and extract
all text content into markdown files in site/pages/home/. The final page
should render identically to the original. See AGENTS.md for the full guide.
```

**Adding a new component:**
```
Create a Pricing component with 3-column cards. It should support light and
dark themes. Use content.items for the pricing tiers — each item has a title,
paragraph (price), and links (CTA button).
```

**Adding a new page:**
```
Add a /contact page with a hero section and a form section. Reuse the Hero
component from the homepage. Create a new ContactForm component for the form.
```
